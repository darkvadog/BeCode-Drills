# Wikipedia Scraper 
- Repository: `scraping-leader-wikipedia`

## Main purpose
- This code aims at building a JSON file with the political leaders of each country retrieved from a list of countries provided by [this API](https://country-leaders.onrender.com/docs):
    - You will ultimately find in this file the first paragraph of the Wikipedia page of each of these leaders

### Preparation:
- Download/clone the full repository which should at least contain the following files:
    - main.py
    - requirements.txt
    - a 'src' folder with: scraper.py
- Open your favourite IDE, access the folder and install the required packages and librairies by typing "pip install requirements.txt" in the terminal

#### Action
- Open your favourite IDE and type "python main.py" in the terminal from the project directory:
    - it will eventually ask you to provide the path to the output file, simply type "output.json"
